## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
The build is optimized for the best performance, and the filenames include hashes for cache busting.  
Your app is now ready for deployment.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation!**  
Once you eject, you can't go back.  
This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all configuration files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project. You’ll have full control over these files and can tweak them as needed. However, be aware that you’ll be on your own for maintaining the configuration.

## Folder Structure

After running `npm start`, you’ll see the following folder structure:
